Generates rudimentary bibtex file by parsing \cite*{}
references in a document(s), and crossreferences the citekeys
with the ones in your Papers2 databse.

Requires Python >= 2.5 and Papers >= 2.0.8

Create a `~/.papersrc` to override default settings. This file should be
formatted such that Python's ConfigParser can read it.

For instance, I store my Papers2 folder in my Dropbox, so my `~/.papersrc`
file looks like so:

    [appinfo]
    dbpath = /Users/stavros/Dropbox/Papers2/Library.papers2/Database.papersdb
