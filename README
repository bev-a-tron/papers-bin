The papers.py script drives functionality against Papers2

Currently this script was written to auto-generate a bibtex file for the
citations used in 1+ latex files. To generate one bibtex file to stdout
for all of the *.tex files in the current directory, put papers.py in
your PATH and:

    $ papers.py bibtex *.tex > refs.bib

Requires Python >= 2.5 and Papers >= 2.0.8

Create a `~/.papersrc` to override default settings. This file should be
formatted such that Python's ConfigParser can read it.

For instance, I store my Papers2 folder in my Dropbox, so my `~/.papersrc`
file looks like so:

    [appinfo]
    dbpath = /Users/stavros/Dropbox/Papers2/Library.papers2/Database.papersdb

Note that this program is not endorsed by the authors of Papers.app.

The functionality in this script will perform READ-ONLY queries against your
Papers.app sqlite database. I cannot guarantee that it will not corrupt your
database (it really shouldn't, though, as I use this program often), so use it
at your own risk.
