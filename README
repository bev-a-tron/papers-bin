The papers.py script drives functionality against Papers2

Currently this script was written to auto-generate a bibtex file for the
citations used in 1+ latex files. To generate one bibtex file to stdout
for all of the *.tex files in the current directory, put papers.py in
your PATH and:

    $ papers.py bibtex *.tex > refs.bib

Requires Python >= 2.5 and Papers >= 2.0.8

Create a `~/.papersrc` to override default settings. This file should be
formatted such that Python's ConfigParser can read it.

For instance, I store my Papers2 folder in my Dropbox, so my `~/.papersrc`
file looks like so:

    [appinfo]
    dbpath = /Users/stavros/Dropbox/Papers2/Library.papers2/Database.papersdb

Feel free to submit bugs/feature request through the tickets for this project. If you fork and extend this project, I'll gladly accept pull requests.

DISCLAIMER
----------

This script is not supported or endorsed by the Papers2 team. I'm making queries directly against the Papers database, the structure of which may change whenever they seem it fit to do so.

The functionality in the scripts provided will perform READ-ONLY queries
against your Papers.app sqlite database. I cannot guarantee that it will not 
corrupt your database, so use it at your own risk.

That having been said, I use this script too, so it really shouldn't corrupt
your database.  Murphy's law being what it is and all, I feel compelled
to write this blurb in case it wasn't obvious.
